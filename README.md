# Inventory Performance & COGS Optimization Analysis

## Overview

The **Inventory Performance & COGS Optimization Analysis** project provides an in-depth analysis of inventory levels, cost of goods sold (COGS), stockouts, and profitability to optimize supply chain management and drive more informed decision-making. By analyzing key metrics such as inventory turnover, stockout rates, and profitability, this project helps businesses improve inventory management, reduce operational costs, and enhance profitability.

## Objective

The primary goal of this analysis is to help businesses optimize their inventory practices by:
- Improving inventory turnover to better utilize capital.
- Identifying and reducing stockout occurrences, which lead to lost sales.
- Analyzing COGS and profitability to make cost-effective operational decisions.

## Data Analyzed

This analysis uses the following data points:
- **Date**: Represents the time dimension of the dataset.
- **Product ID**: Unique identifier for each product.
- **Product Name**: The name of the product.
- **3-Month Moving Average**: Forecasted inventory levels based on past data.
- **Average Inventory**: The mean value of inventory across the analysis period.
- **Closing Inventory**: The inventory available at the end of each period.
- **COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)**: The direct costs incurred in producing the products sold.
- **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: Measures the efficiency of inventory usage and turnover.
- **Opening Inventory**: The starting inventory at the beginning of each period.
- **Purchases**: Quantity of products added to inventory.
- **Stockout Detection**: An indicator of stockouts, where product demand exceeds available inventory.

## Key Metrics

1. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: Measures how efficiently a company is managing its inventory and how frequently it is sold and replaced over a period.
2. **COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)**: Represents the total cost incurred in manufacturing or purchasing the goods sold during the period.
3. **Stockout Rate**: The percentage of time a product is out of stock, impacting customer satisfaction and lost sales.
4. **Lost Sales**: Measures the revenue lost due to stockouts, helping businesses understand the financial impact of insufficient stock.
5. **KPIs**:
   - **Total COGS**: Overall cost of goods sold across all products.
   - **Total Inventory**: The sum of all product inventory levels.
   - **Stockout Rate**: The percentage of periods where a stockout occurs.

## Visualizations

- **Bar Charts**: Used to visualize COGS, inventory turnover, and stockout occurrences over time.
- **Line Charts**: Show trends in inventory levels, COGS, and stockout rates across different periods.
- **Heatmaps**: Identify patterns of stockouts and inefficiencies in inventory management.
- **KPI Cards**: Display high-level metrics such as total COGS, inventory levels, and stockout rate for quick insights.
- **Scatter Plots**: Examine relationships between inventory turnover and profitability across products.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Inventory Management**: Understand when to reorder products, reduce carrying costs, and avoid stockouts.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Gain insights into COGS and identify opportunities to lower production or procurement costs.
- **Increased Profitability**: Optimize inventory and reduce stockouts to enhance overall profitability.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Make informed decisions regarding inventory procurement, stock levels, and product availability.

## Tools Used

- **Tableau**: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Excel**: Data preprocessing, calculations, and initial analysis.
- **SQL/Python (Optional)**: For advanced data manipulation, automation, and reporting.
